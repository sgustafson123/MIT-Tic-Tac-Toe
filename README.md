# MIT-Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a stylized version of Tic-Tac-Toe built in React.

##How to Use
Click on a square to claim that square.  X always goes first.  Once the game has been won, the game will announce the winner.

##Improvements
Potential improvements could include:  
Using different symbols
Using different colors
Making the board larger with a background picture displayed
Offering the game in multiple languages
Changing the squares into a different shape

##Larger improvements
I would like to improve the game by having the color of the squares change to highlight the winner - either X or O.  Maybe this could be done by changing the state of the squares, or a conditional tied to the logic that determines the winner?

It would also be fun to experiment with offering different symbols or languages or colors.  The user could click a button to select the language, a button for the symbol set, a button for color palette.
